**key is, this is not merely implementation; think/learn-deeply about the theory too
  ie. communication between neurons during fw/bw-pass

Basic NN with numpy
Transformer with numpy (attention-heads)
Hopfield Net (<-- associative memory review)
Program Synthesis (starting with basic, non-DL ones)

**for fun after, implement some basic stuff (ie. derivative, etc. in lisp)
